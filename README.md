# Pi Calculator
Pi approximation calculator graphicaly showing the approximation to Pi in relation to number of points calculated.

Created for practice as part of my "Embedded systems" course during 3rd year of my BSc studies.

## Precision:
The precision is depending on nuber of points we inserted, more points = more precise.

## Radius:
If the radius will be smaller, the precision will get higher as we have the same number of points covering a smaller area.

# Pi Calculator
Pi approximation calculator graphicaly showing the approximation to Pi in relation to number of points calculated.



## Precision:
The precision is depending on nuber of points we inserted, more points = more precise.

## Radius:
If the radius will be smaller, the precision will get higher as we have the same number of points covering a smaller area.
